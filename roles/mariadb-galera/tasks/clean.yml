##  Replace existing MySQL daemon
##  =============================


# These tasks are run if these variables are set:
#   - db_stop means that mysql service is stopped and any residual process is killed.
#   - db_init implies db_stop. Additionally, the data directory is emptied.


- name: Stop mysql service, if any
  become: yes
  service:
    name=mysql
    state=stopped
  when: (db_stop is defined and db_stop == '1') or (db_init is defined and db_init == '1')

# The reason why we do this is that if Galera fails at startup
# mysqld_safe could remain active even if the service is stopped
- name: Kill musqld_safe and mysqld, if still active
  become: yes
  shell: >
    true killall -9 "{{ item }}"
  with_items:
    - mysqld_safe
    - mysqld
  when: (db_stop is defined and db_stop == '1') or (db_init is defined and db_init == '1')

- name: Empty datadir
  become: yes
  shell: >
    rm -Rf "{{ mysql_data_dir }}"
  when: db_init is defined and db_init == '1'
